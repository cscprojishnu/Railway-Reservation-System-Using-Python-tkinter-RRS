1. Always start the program by entering your mysql server password in database.py and sqlconnect.py and never change the database name from rrs.
2. Always start the program from database.py if you are running the code for the very first time to create a database and required tables in the server.
3. If you are not running the first time then start the code from main.py
4. Never change anything in the source code file - functions.py
5. Always install the bg.png file also for good background image.
6. Never change the name of any file which was done by the coder.
